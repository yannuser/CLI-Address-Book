# CLI Address Book (Python)

A simple **command-line address book** built in Python to practice key software engineering concepts such as  **object-oriented programming (OOP)** ,  **file I/O** ,  **JSON serialization** , and  **exception handling** .

---

## Features

* Add, search, delete, and list contacts
* Case-insensitive name and email search
* Data persistence using JSON
* Graceful exception handling (file not found, bad JSON, etc.)
* Clean modular OOP structure (`Contact` + `AddressBook`)
* Simple CLI user interface

---

## Learning Goals

* Apply OOP principles (encapsulation, modular design)
* Work with JSON read/write for persistent storage
* Implement error handling in real-world scenarios
* Structure a small CLI program with multiple files
